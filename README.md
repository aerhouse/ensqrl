# ensqrl

Swift-native implementations of [SQRL](https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm)'s enhash and enscrypt functions using Apple's crypto frameworks.

**Warning**: Until macOS 10.15 is stable enough to work on, `enscrypt` uses insecure strings to represent the password for testing purposes. This will be replaced with the CryptoKit-provided `SymmetricKey` struct.
